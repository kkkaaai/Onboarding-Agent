ABOUT THE PROJECT
-----------------
The Aurora Design System is Raspberry Coffee's next-generation design and component framework. It delivers a cohesive, accessible, and sensory-rich experience across hardware and software. Built as a Figma + React component library, it standardizes color tokens, typography, motion, and layout spacing across all Raspberry products.

GETTING STARTED
---------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/JieHan-eng/aurora-design-system.git
   cd aurora-design-system

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
   
3. Run Storybook (development):
   npm run storybook
   
4. Run tests:
   npm test

5. Build the library:
   npm run build

TECH STACK
----------
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Storybook 7.x
- Tailwind CSS
- Figma API (for token sync)
- axe-core (accessibility testing)
- Jest + React Testing Library

CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES
-----------------------
1. Create a feature branch from main:
   git checkout -b feature/component-name

2. Follow naming conventions:
   - Components: PascalCase (Button.tsx)
   - Hooks: camelCase with "use" prefix (useTheme.ts)
   - Utilities: camelCase (formatDate.ts)

3. Write tests for all components:
   - Unit tests with Jest
   - Accessibility tests with axe-core
   - Visual regression tests in Storybook

4. Update Storybook stories:
   - Create a .stories.tsx file for each component
   - Document all props and variants
   - Include usage examples

5. Sync design tokens:
   - Run npm run sync-figma to pull latest tokens
   - Commit token changes separately

6. Submit a pull request:
   - Write clear PR description
   - Link related Jira tickets
   - Request review from Rania Boutros or Diego Alvarez
   - Ensure all CI checks pass

CODE STYLE
----------
- Follow Prettier configuration
- Use ESLint rules (no warnings allowed)
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use named exports (not default exports)

DESIGN TOKENS
-------------
Tokens are synced from Figma and stored in src/tokens/:
- colors.ts - Color palette (primary, secondary, semantic)
- spacing.ts - Spacing scale (4px base)
- typography.ts - Font families, sizes, weights
- shadows.ts - Elevation system
- motion.ts - Animation durations and easings

ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------
All components must:
- Pass WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Support keyboard navigation
- Include ARIA labels where needed
- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text
- Work with screen readers

TESTING STRATEGY
----------------
- Unit tests: 80%+ coverage required
- Integration tests: Key user flows
- Visual tests: Automated screenshot comparison
- Accessibility tests: Run axe-core on all components
- Manual testing: Test in Chrome, Safari, Firefox

DEPLOYMENT
----------
The package is published as @raspberry-coffee/aurora to NPM (private registry).
Only maintainers can publish:
- Rania Boutros (UX Lead)
- Priya Nair (Director of Application Engineering)

USEFUL COMMANDS
---------------
npm run storybook       # Start Storybook dev server
npm run build           # Build the library
npm run test            # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Run tests in watch mode
npm run lint            # Check for linting errors
npm run format          # Format code with Prettier
npm run sync-figma      # Sync design tokens from Figma
npm run chromatic       # Run visual regression tests

COMMON ISSUES
-------------
Q: Figma tokens not syncing?
A: Check FIGMA_TOKEN in .env.local and ensure you have access to the Figma file.

Q: Storybook not loading components?
A: Clear cache: rm -rf node_modules/.cache

Q: TypeScript errors after pulling?
A: Run npm install to update types

Q: Tests failing locally?
A: Ensure you're on Node 18+ and have latest dependencies
